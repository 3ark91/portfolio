   <details>
      <summary>Learning Outcomes</summary>
  
      1. explain how data and information is represented within a computer system and how it is manipulated to solve problems in a range of disciplines
      2. solve problems and design software solutions using a high-level programming language and a range of technologies, protocols and algorithms
      3. apply basic collaborative software development practices to work effectively with team members on small-scale software development projects
      4. understand basic interaction design principles and apply these to the development of interactive software; and
      5. demonstrate effectively written and oral communication skills to convey information, approaches and design decisions to a range of audiences

* Introduction to Programming and the UNIX Environment (COSC110)
   * Further develop programming skills, gain exposure to UNIX systems 
   * Language(s) - Python
   <details>
      <summary>Learning Outcomes</summary>
  
      1. solve problems using a structured approach by constructing and implementing algorithms using a high-level programming language, making use of a range of data-types, control structures, parameter passing, functions and procedures
      2. describe and apply good program development practices and/or coding style to the production of software
      3. analyse and debug computer programs to describe their purpose and identify logic and syntactical errors whenever they are present
      4. explain the principles of intellectual property and how they relate to the ethical considerations surrounding control and availability of information technology
      5. explain the history and status of information technology by identifying key developments and their relationship with current techniques or technologies and
      6. understand and apply the tools and commands available in UNIX-type operating systems for tasks relating to software development, basic administration and data processing.

* Object Oriented Programming (COSC120)
   * Learn OOP concepts 
   * Language(s) - Java
   <details>
      <summary>Learning Outcomes</summary>
  
      1. explain object oriented programming concepts including classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
      2. apply object oriented design principles to algorithm design and analysis and
      3. develop computer programs using Java, which is an object oriented programming language.tion and data processing.

* Database Management Systems (COSC210)
   * Learn to effectively design and manage databases  
   * Language(s) - SQL
   <details>
      <summary>Learning Outcomes</summary>
  
      1. describe the essential components of database management systems (DBMS) and apply data modelling approaches to design databases for real-world scenarios;
      2. explain the principles of the relational model, implement databases using a relational DBMS and understand the architectures that allow application software to use data stored within a database schema;
      3. work with data stored in a relational DBMS by applying SQL to create database tables, extract, present and modify data, and implement integrity that reflect business logic;
      4. understand and apply the principles of normalisation and functional dependencies to assess and optimise a relational schema;
      5. explain the concepts of transaction management, query processing, physical storage and database indexing; and
      6. explain the societal issues around information privacy, as they relate to the storage and dissemination of data, and apply views and permissions to implement security constraints.
